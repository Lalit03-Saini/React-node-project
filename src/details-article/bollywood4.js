Priyanka played the role of Sati in the film. She opened up about her character in the film and told EW, “It was really fun, at least in the physicality, even with the hair, to have references to young Sati. Even the clothes, we treated her like a warrior but at the same time had an homage to her Indiana roots. We used colors which were Indian. We had borders of sarees. Little details which were so amazing and so well done by the team that as soon as I put it on there was something very sacred about who I became.”
