                    Filming has begun on the four sequels to Avatar, James Cameron’s 2009
                    3-D CGI adventure about a paraplegic marine who lands on the planet Pandora to mine unobtainium.

                    This time, though, Cameron is really gonna make it happen — he’s not playing around! He’s spent much of the last decade teasing us about the upcoming installments, throwing out piecemeal updates (with occasional breaks for a Titanic rerelease or to shade Alien: Covenant). But this time, he’s serious. Avatar 2 even has a title, The Way of Water. It’s the first of the installments known as the The Avatar Sequels, which will come with a budget of $1 billion. (That’s three and a half Lord of the Rings trilogies, six Wonder Womans, 66 Hurt Lockers, and 250 Moonlights.)
