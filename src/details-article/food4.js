                    Are kids eating the same healthy food as adults?

                    Every parent is concerned about feeding their kid the most healthy foods. But did you know that healthy foods for kids and adults are the same. Yes, this will leave you surprised but as per a recent study there’s no difference between foods for adults and kids except the taste and texture of foods for infants aged 2 years or older. The study was published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, published by Elsevier. "If you think about kids food, the archetype or terminology that we widely use to describe the food that we feed our children, it is really a social norm or societal construct that we have perpetuated," says Pamela Rothpletz-Puglia, EdD, RD, School of Health Professions, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA Kids food is operationally defined as food likely to be consumed by children aged 2-14 years, either at home or in the community. There is a long-held belief in the United States that children need different types of foods than adults, and many of these foods are highly processed; energy-dense; and high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar.
