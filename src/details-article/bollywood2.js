                    Hrithik Roshan is finally stepping on the wrong side of the law in Vikram Vedha and his first look from the film was released on his birthday on Monday. A remake of the Tamil hit by the same name, the film stars Saif Ali Khan as Vikram with Radhika Apte in a pivotal role. Pushkar and Gayatri, who wrote and directed the original, are at the helm with this film too. Termed as a neo-noir thriller by its makers, Vikram Vedha is inspired by the folktale of Vikram aur Betaal. The film tells the story of a tough police officer who sets out to track down and kill an equally tough gangster. This original Tamil blockbuster starred R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi.
