                Alphabet-owned Google said on Tuesday its cloud division had acquired Israeli cybersecurity startup Siemplify, as the US tech giant expands its security offerings amid rising cyber attacks.Financial details o the deal were not disclosed by the companies, but a source familiar with the matter said Google paid about $500 million(roughly Rs. 3, 730 crore) in cash for Siemplify.The deal came after Google made a pledge to US President Joe Biden last August to invest $10 billion(roughly Rs. 74, 520 crore) in cybersecurity over the next five years, amid a significant rise in cyber attacks and data breaches.Since the pandemic started in 2020, Google revenue from the cloud business has nearly doubled to around $5 billion(roughly Rs. 37, 260 crore) as companies shifted to working from home.The need to protect and hedge against security threats has shot up in tandem, with big corporates also beefing up on cybersecurity products.
