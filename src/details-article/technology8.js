                    A seawater greenhouse is a greenhouse structure that enables the growth of crops and the production of fresh water in arid regions which constitute about one third of the earth's land area

                <div className="homeboxdesctop">
                    The Sahara Forest Project (SFP) combines the seawater greenhouse technology and concentrated solar power and constructed pilot projects in Jordan and Qatar. The seawater greenhouse evaporates 50 m3 of seawater and harvests 5 m3 of fresh water per hectare per day.[7] The solar power production capacity through PV panels produces 39 KW on the 3 hectares area with 1350 m2 growing area.[8] The greenhouses are 15 degrees cooler than the outside temperatures which enables the production up to 130,000 kg vegetables produced per year and up to 20,000 liters of fresh water production per day.[8] Additionally, the project includes revegetation by soil reclamation of nitrogen-fixing and salt-removing desert plants by repurposed waste products from agriculture and saltwater evaporation.[8]
