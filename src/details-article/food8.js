                    Have you ever imagined what happens when you have too much salt in your body? Well, it can lead to various health issues like high blood pressure, stroke or even heart diseases. It is for this reason that one should not have too much salt in their food. Salt, which is also known as sodium chloride is used in various food preparations to enhance the taste and is a stabilizer. It is also used as a preservative, as bacteria cannot thrive in the presence of a high amount of salt. The mineral present in salt - sodium, is required by the human body to maintain a proper balance of the body. Packed with potassium, a banana can help in keeping your blood pressure levels in check after a salty meal, which can lower the risk of a stroke over time. This fruit is also rich in fibre and thus it can help in lowering the risk of heart diseases as well. It is yet another food rich in potassium that can counter the risk of high sodium. Not just that, it can change your taste quickly while keeping your gut healthy.
